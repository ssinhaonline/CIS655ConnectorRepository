# CIS655ConnectorRepository
Common files between all AMIs

Acts as a bridge between all AMIs on EC2, and provides the prerequisite files for all instances. This is a very project specific repo. Should not make much sense for user. Please refer to the document called 'Project Report.pdf' on the AWSProjectCIS655 repository https://github.com/ssinhaonline/AWSProjectCIS655 for detailed information.
